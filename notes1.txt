create a dictionary of free tiles

use pq to track total no of tiles left

1) place piece at tile for all possible places
no of free spaces left

all pieces in a list <-- to iterate (determine variable to assign to)

store states as pq (2)
state: (pop out most no of pieces on board and most no of free tiles)
3. no of free tiles
4. dic of free tiles
5. total no of pieces placed
6. path --> add check if attacking tiles in area with pieces
inference:
if no of free tiles == 0, discard

order of adding add queen, empress, princess, rook, bishop, knight, king, ferz
